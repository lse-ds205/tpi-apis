"""Tests for ascor-api endpoints.

This module contains automated tests to validate the functionality of our API endpoints
defined in v1/app.py. It uses FastAPI's TestClient for making HTTP requests and pytest
as the testing framework.

This module relies on the following fixtures defined in conftest.py:

- client: A FastAPI TestClient instance that allows us to emulate sending HTTP requests to
    our FastAPI application.

Current tests:
- Country data endpoint (/v1/country-data/{country_code}/{year})
