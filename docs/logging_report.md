**Title**: [ALL] Add comprehensive logging system across API

**Reviewer**: @jonjoncardoso


## Major changes
- I have added a logging system for the API. 
- I did this by creating a file called log_config.py. The "application log can include your own messages integrated with messages from third-party modules" according to the official python documentation. 
- I used Logging Middleware, a tool that is a custom middleware for FastAPI
- It helps log all requests and responses including status codes, content, methods, paths, etc: **source** : https://medium.com/@dhavalsavalia/fastapi-logging-middleware-logging-requests-and-responses-with-ease-and-style-201b9aa4001a
- [TIME][LEVEL] MODULE_NAME: MESSAGE
- it also los messages that include the the original module for an easy source identification
- I also implemented a tpi_api.log file that stores the logs and is stored longterm. 
-   Here it is ![Logging System](../tpi_apis/images/logging.png)
- - Here it is:
    ![Logging System](/Users/rishisiddharth/Desktop/LSE_2024_2045/classes/DS205W/Summative1_logging/tpi_apis/images/logging.png) (I did it twice bcos neither of them are showing up jsut in case I will include a copy and pasate of the output)
